# electron-bitchute
An unofficial electron app for bitchute.

This is a *verry* early alpha of a desktop bitchute app. You should **not** use
this over a web browser _yet_. I do have plans to add desktop notifications and
other things like that. The ultimate goal will be to have a fast, low profile
app that can run in resource constrained environments. If you want to help out
thank you so much.
